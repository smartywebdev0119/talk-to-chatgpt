Talk-To-ChatGPT is a simple javascript snippet that will turn on voice recognition (also known as speech-to-text) so that you can actually speak to ChatGPT. When you receive a reply, the reply will be read out loud using text-to-speech.

The code is simple and uses standard Google Chrome APIs.

It needs to be loaded through the javascript console in Google Chrome, but you can also create a bookmarklet to enable it in a simpler way.

There are several settings you can tweak, these are found at the top of the javascript file.
